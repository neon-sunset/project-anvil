- [ ] Throw helpers to reduce codegen size
- [ ] Align SVec impl. with NVec and Vec
- [ ] Complete the implementation of vecs
- [ ] Add basic test coverage
- [ ] Try to vendor TerraFX.Mimalloc and build it without assertions (or not for sharing the allocator globally)
--------------------
Goals
- Allocator calls must involve at most a single cctor check
- Allocator calls must not have extra stubs/trampolines/frames
- Allocator calls must be ideally cheaper than GC calls
- Taking on a dependency must not significantly increase binary size
- The library must be able to use system-provided allocator
