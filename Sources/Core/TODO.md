- [ ] Throw helpers to reduce codegen size
- [ ] Align SVec impl. with NVec and Vec
- [ ] Complete the implementation of vecs
- [ ] Add basic test coverage
- [ ] Try to vendor TerraFX.Mimalloc and build it without assertions (or not for sharing the allocator globally)
--------------------
Goals
- Allocator calls must involve at most a single cctor check
- Allocator calls must not have extra stubs/trampolines/frames
- Allocator calls must be ideally cheaper than GC calls
- Taking on a dependency must not significantly increase binary size
- The library must be able to use system-provided allocator
--------------------
- [ ] Consider "flattening" iter operators by offering chaining via base flat iter holder (i.e. `Iter<T1..Tn>`)
--------------------
API
- Allocators
    - ManagedAllocator: Pool, GC
    - ScopedAllocator: GC, any unmanaged
    - NativeAllocator: Global, Jemalloc
- Containers
    - Vec{T}, Vec{T, A}
    - SVec{T, A}
    - NVec{T}, NVec{T, A}
    - Slice{T}, MutSlice{T}
- Iterators
    - Iter{T}, IterMut{T}
    - IntoIter{T}, IntoIterMut{T}?
    - Standard operators (map, filter, fold, zip, etc.)
